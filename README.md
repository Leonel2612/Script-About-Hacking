# Script about hacking
A little project about how I got access to the computer of the person who ran this script
You will find two scripts the script with the name "Hackerprint" is all the code that I made to get all the information about the person and the webs pages that the person will visit after running the program
The following script with the name "setup" is the one that will give you a .exe and you can change the name of that .exe, this will run the code that I made before in the script "Hackerprint".
